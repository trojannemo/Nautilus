Stems Isolator: How To Use

Either drag-and-drop the file or click on the ... button to select a file
At this point, only single songs are allowed, no packs (sorry!) - you can use Quick Pack Editor's dePACK feature to easily split packed songs into individual CONs

Stems Isolator will read the DTA file and determine which audio tracks can be isolated...
Select the track(s) you want to isolate, choose a Mode and click 'Begin'

Stems Isolator has three modes:

Split audio to stems:
- with this option, Stems Isolator will take an unencrypted mogg and it will automatically split the audio into the stems you have selected
- you can select one or multiple or all the stems available in the audio
- in this mode, you can click on Audio Format and select WAV (default) or OGG as the format to encode the isolated stems

Downmix to stereo:
- with this option enabled, Stems Isolator will take the DTA attenuation and panning values and downmix the multitrack audio into a stereo file
- in this mode, you can click on Audio Format and select WAV (default) or OGG as the format to encode the stereo file

Prepare CON for recording  (deprecated):
- this prepares a CON file to be used for inline recording on your Xbox
- Stems Isolator will make a copy of your input file and work on that
- it will create the necessary songs.dta edits and rebuild the song as an anonymous, signed CON file ready to go on your Xbox
- yes, it will only be one CON file, all variations will be accounted for in the songs.dta file
