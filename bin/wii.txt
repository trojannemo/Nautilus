Using C3 Customs on Wii

This archive contains the 2 content folders necessary to package these custom songs on your Wii.

The naming format is for your reference and is required for your packing folder structure and C3 CON Tools.

000_00000000_songname_meta
000_00000000_songname_song

The first three zeroes are the BIN file number (in decimal) it will pack to. You need to set this yourself to properly change the name path in songs.dta.

The next eight zeroes become the app file it packs to. It will be the first number in hex, assuming the custom sZWE generation is used.

Use the Smart Folder Merge feature in C3 CON Tools' Wii Converter to combine these song folders into one file.
