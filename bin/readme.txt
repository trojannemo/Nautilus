RB3 Scores Viewer
A tool to view and edit scores in Rock Band 3 save files for Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii.

With this tool, you can view and edit:
-All saved data about a song in a save file, including: star and percent score for every instrument on every difficulty.
-The top score on every instrument for a song, and the difficulty it was earned on.
-Progress for the Pro instrument-only "Train Song" training mode for every section (up to 32 sections) and every difficulty.
-The Lighter rating and play count for a song.

-Export individual scores or all scores in a raw binary format.
-Import multiple scores, even between consoles.
-Delete individual or multiple scores.
-Export all scores in a tabulated text file (CSV).

After you open a valid save file, the console the save is from is indicated in the bottom left corner of the edit UI. When a Wii save is loaded, clicking on the name next to the console will switch between the 4 profiles.
Multi-selection is allowed on the list. When multiple selections are made, pressing the Delete key will immediately delete those scores. This cannot be undone.
Hover over a field to get an explanation about it if something is unclear.
The maximum song limit for Xbox 360 and PS3 is 2999 and for Wii it is 999. These hardcoded limits cannot be bypassed.
Certain fields are allowed to be larger than would be normally attainable (percent) or possible to display (lighter rating, stars). A warning should appear when this is the case to preserve the data.
