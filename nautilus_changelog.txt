-------------------

FEATURES / CHANGE LOG:

v5.5.1

SAVE FILE IMAGE EDITOR
- Rewrote entire code that EXTRACTS information and images from the save file and also the code that REWRITES the information and images back to the save file - should address the recent issues popping up with RPCS3 PS3 save files - I'm interested to hear from you if you still encounter failures or crashes when editing your save file

DTA PARSER
- Fixed error introduced in v5.5.0 that would show incorrect song durations throughout the entire program since I broke a function in the DTA Parser

---

v5.5.0

ROCK BAND TO KARAOKE CONVERTER (NEW FEATURE!)
- Converts Rock Band song files to .mp3 + .cdg files for use with most karaoke players - see Help information in the tool

SETLIST MANAGER
- Added field to keep track of when a song is added to your setlist - this will work best when making a new setlist going forward as it has no way of knowing retroactively when you added something - you can sort by date just like you can sort by all other fields
- Merged pull request by jcollums that added filtering option for songs with no vocals (before it was just only masculine and feminine, now there's a third option)
- Fixed broken importing of yarg.json and Clone Hero ch.json setlists - thanks to RazQ for pointing out the issue
- Fixed code that searches for lyrics to the selected song to get around bug in the API that would hang when it didn't recognize the song, freezing Nautilus

QUICK PACK EDITOR
- Fixed broken dePACKing feature that was apparently broken since v5.4.0??? Should work fine now

CLONE HERO CONVERTER
- Merged pull request by jcollums that fixed the "don't add hopo threshold" toggle as brought up by ataeaf
- Added placeholder video_start_time = line to the .ini file as requested by MrPrezident

SAVE FILE IMAGE EDITOR
- Fixed (?) long-standing issue with transparent art images when being applied in game to characters
- Added workaround for user ScientistsSay (and anyone else on the same boat) that has their images offset off by one byte - click on Options and select ScientistsSay Offset Fix and try loading your PS3 save then

QUICK DTA EDITOR
- Merged pull request by jcollums that fixed Quick DTA Editor not detecting when there were no changes to the DTA file

UPGRADE BUNDLER
Fixed issue where bundling MIDI with MIDI would fail due to missing DTA file (which was not needed)

MAIN FORM
- Moved around a ton of buttons to re-organize in a way that (to me) makes more sense
- Removed button for Video Preparer as that feature is not being used by anyone in 2025 - if you still need it, it can be accessed via shortcut argument
- Fixed quirky behavior that would sometimes default to the black starry sky background image, which would make it seem as if all the (transparent) buttons disappeared

---

v5.4.2
FRAMEWORK
- Downgraded from .NET Framework 4.8.1 to .NET Framework 4.8.0 for compatibility for Windows 7 users without having to manually modify the .exe.config file

SNG FILE PROCESSING (this affects any Tool that interacts with Clone Hero SNG files or YARG YARGSONG files)
- Removed BinaryEx as an external library and integrated the code directly into Nautilus to avoid a problem for Linux on WINE users - thanks to mdsitton for the library and to Oznogon for all the WINE troubleshooting help

VISUALIZER
- Modified code for loading the default Myriad Pro Bold font that apparently wasn't working well for older Windows versions - still not working well for WINE users please let me know if you find a solution

CON EXPLORER
- Rock Band Blitz is now an option thanks to contribution from InvoxiPlayGames

CON CREATOR
- Rock Band Blitz is now an option thanks to contribution from InvoxiPlayGames

SAVE SCORES VIEWER v2.4 (Thanks be to StackOverflow0x!)
- Fixed issue that was destroying all pro trainer progress if you interacted with it

MILOMOD v1.8f (Thanks be to StackOverflow0x!)
- Minor fix for stability

---

v5.4.1

SNG FILE PROCESSING (this affects any Tool that interacts with Clone Hero SNG files or YARG YARGSONG files)
- Integrated source code of SNG File Format library right into Nautilus so we can handle SNG files natively without needing to call the external application sngCLI - this also gives me more control of how to process SNG files, which in turns means that the conversion from YARGSONG to extracted folder now happens in one go without needing an intermediary SNG file on disk - thanks to mdsitton for the library
- Eliminating sngCLI should also fix one more "Nautilus on Linux using WINE" issue - let me know!

VOLUME NORMALIZER (thanks be to Sean!)
- Fixed culture problems
- Added more logging to Verbose Output
- Fixed an issue with DTA writing

VISUALIZER
- Implemented video playback for Clone Hero style song formats (folder/sng files/yargsong files) - supports background.avi, video.mp4, video.webm, bg.mp4 and bg.webm - if your song has a video background it'll play instead of showing the album art - click on it to enlarge it - click on it to return it to smaller size - you can disable playback on the CH Options menu at the top
- Now reads video_start_time value in song.ini files that have it
- Improved reading of custom colors for Clone Hero charter name
- Now lets you click on the author name to search for their songs on RhythmVerse - only works for single authors, not multi author collaborations

SETLIST MANAGER
- Fixed deleting songs from the Setlist, where it wouldn't actually do anything after the v5.4.0 update
- Fixed editing songs from the Setlist, where it would crash after the v5.4.0 update
- Fixed songcache not importing correctly after the v5.4.0 update

QUICK PACK EDITOR
- Added (or added back??? who knows!) option to dePACK a pack songs.dta file into component DTA files (useful for PS3 peeps)
- Added check so if the programming code to hide the pack from Rock Band 3 (introduced in Pack Creator recently) is found, it is not kept as part of the dePACKed DTA files

CON EXPLORER
- Added work-around for users running Nautilus on Linux using WINE who found the copy buttons would not work for them - let me know if this is an improvement

PS3 CONVERTER
- Fixed bug where when using the Batch PS3 Fixer if the song already had a numeric ID, it wouldn't save the edits to the mogg file

MAIN FORM
- Minor change but should eliminate a crash for users running Nautilus on Linux using WINE
- Fixed long-standing bug that would sometimes open Nautilus only showing a tiny portion of the screen - thanks to jnack for finally figuring out what caused it!

----------

v5.4.0

BATCH PROCESSOR
- Added option to remove subgenre from DTA files
- Added option to batch change from Magma's Karaoke or Multitrack tag to DIY Stems tag

AUDIO CONVERTER
- Added ability to convert Bink (.bik) audio files (encrypted or not) directly to .mogg format in one go by drag/dropping your Bink file(s) on the appropriate button - thanks to StackOverflow0x for making this possible!
- Added ability to convert mono audio files to mono (before it would automatically make them fake stereo)

VISUALIZER
- Added ability to read DIY Stems tag from Magma: Rok On Edition v4
- Added ability to read Partial Multitrack tag from Magma: Rok On Edition v4
- Added ability to read Unpitched Vocals tag from Magma: Rok On Edition v4
- Added ability to read author tag from DTA array (useful for RB3DX and for songs created with Magma: Rok On Edition v4)

SETLIST MANAGER
- Major rework of the code to enable near instant loading times when loading thousands of songs in your SETLIST - please let me know if anything broke!
- Now when selecting a single song, Setlist Manager automatically attempts to find the corresponding YouTube video and presents you with a button to click to open on YouTube
- Now when selecting a single song, Setlist Manager automatically attempts to find the song lyrics and presents you with a button to click to view the lyrics right in Nautilus
- Added 2020s+ filter option to filter songs from 2020 and on...and there's space for a 2030s+ if we get that far!

MIDI CLEANER
- Added option (enabled by default) to remove erroneous “[lighting ()]” event at the beginning of the VENUE track, which prevents any lighting cues from autogenerating when compiling with Magma - will also generate a .log file in the same folder as the input file(s) that will list all songs that had this issue so you can then drag/drop into Magma Rok On Edition and quickly recompiled
- Added feature that will fix directed cuts in the VENUE track that require a second copy of the same camera event or the game would ignore the next camera event
- Improved detection and removal of drum fills that overlap overdrive phrases (was working before, but not very well due to poor logic assumptions)

PACK CREATOR
- Totally reworked how file encoding works, now it defaults to UTF8 (which can display all ANSI/latin1 characters, but not the other way around) and encodes the resulting DTA file as UTF8 without BOM (reducing likelihood of problems) AND now it will replace all entries in the pack DTAs' encoding lines to match the file encoding, so Rock Band gets the instruction that matches the actual file encoding. Can still choose ANSI/latin1 but it is recommended that you use UTF8 going forward
- Added option under Advanced menu to Hide from RB3 where Pack Creator will wrap the DTA file in code so it works in RB2 but not in RB3
- Attempted patch to fix issue created by old code where empty "songs" and "songs_upgrades" folders would prevent the creation of a pack when using the folder structure that seems to be so popular lately - let me know if you stille encounter issues
- Fixed buttons losing their backcolor and forecolor when clicking on the Reset button

QUICK PACK EDITOR
- Changed behavior so now you can go to Advanced -> dePACK options -> Use ArtistSongShortName and that will be the file name for dePACKed files, greately reducing the possibility of file conflicts and songs being skipped during dePACKing

SAVE FILE IMAGE EDITOR
- Fixed broken compatibility with Wii save files where it would detect them and extract them but fail to find the converted (.png) files

WII CONVERTER
- Fixed bug where if the backing track was mono and had a panning value of 0.0 (centered) it would cause a crash because the code was looking for another channel that didn't exist

BATCH PROCESSOR
- Fixed rare bug where adding release year to the song title would create a broken DTA file if the song had the song title in the shortname/id/internal name
- Fixed behavior so if a song that already had the year added to the song title is ran through the Batch Processor again, it wouldn't add it again and again

DECRYPTION
- Fixed decryption of RB4-era (i.e. Dropmix) mogg files not working unless themethod3.dll was moved to the main directory rather than the bin folder

----------

v5.3.0

VISUALIZER
- Improved handling of audio files with 8 or less channels, should no longer have incorrect audio playback
- Added basic support for playback of DJ Hero and DJ Hero 2 Xbox 360 DLC files - this is experimental, please report issues so I can improve on it
- Added ability to download album art from last.fm by clicking on the last.fm logo - requires Artist and Album for it to work as per the last.fm API
- Added ability to right-click and export album art image to file (useful if download album art from last.fm)
- Added support for Clone Hero <color> tag for the author/charter in the song.ini file
- Added hotfix for displaying author names with ampersand in the name, like Nunchuk & Sygenysis
- Disabled auto shortening of album name as it was not working well with the track # and would break downloading album art from last.fm if the full album name was too long
- Added checkbox (disabled by default) to enable/disable displaying Track # next to Album Name
- Modified as needed to work with new and different SngCli dependency (this is used for Clone Hero .sng and YARG .yargsong files)

SETLIST MANAGER
- Added ability to drag/drop to import YARG .yargsong files so you can keep your YARG setlists complete (requires .NET 8 to be installed - follow prompts if you don't already have it)
- Added ability to drag/drop to import Clone Hero .sng files so you can keep your Clone Hero setlists complete (requires .NET 8 to be installed - follow prompts if you don't already have it) - WILL NOT WORK WITH THE OFFICIAL CLONE HERO SETLIST SNG FILES, ONLY SNG FILES FROM ENCHOR.US OR THOSE MADE WITH CLONE HERO CONVERTER!
- Reworked JSON export so it properly exports into object arrays instead of whatever the heck I was doing before - thanks to Readek for pointing it out
- Added ability to export EVERYTHING when doing a JSON export
- Changed behavior so now when drag/dropping folders from YARG/CH/PS/FS songs it will add all songs inside without popping up a notification for each song
- Fixed bug where YARG and Clone Hero setlists would load but revert to RB3 Mode instead of retaining the correct mode
- Fixed bug in the INI parser that would incorrectly assign the harmony difficulty to vocal parts - as far I can tell there's no vocal parts indicator on the YARG song.ini files so all songs will default to 0 vocal parts - but you can manually change the value
- Fixed bug that would allow silly values like 16,000 as track number
- Modified as needed to work with new and different SngCli dependency (this is used for Clone Hero .sng and YARG .yargsong files)

CLONE HERO CONVERTER
- Added ability to convert song folders into Clone Hero compatible SNG files (CON to SNG is as simple as CON to CH and CH to SNG)
- Added option to encode audio to Opus format when packing into SNG files - this will significantly increase processing time, I don't recommend it unless you really need to save space
- Added ability to convert song folders into YARG compatible YARGSONG files (CON to YARGSONG is as simple as CON to CH and CH to YARGSONG)

VOLUME NORMALIZER (thanks to Sean/SuperRiderTH!)
- Rewrote a majority of the code.
- Added support for in memory streaming of audio. This vastly increases speed of the loudness analysis, as it no longer needs to be downmixed first.
- Audio re-rendering support has been added. Now if audio needs to be louder, this can now be accomplished along with sanity checks to prevent you from ruining your files.
- Audio backup support. If audio needs to be re-rendered, the original .mogg file will be saved alongside the CON files.
- Fixed (hopefully) erroneous output in .dta files in European regions. Thanks to RazQ for finding this, and TheNathannator and AddyMills for just knowing how to deal with it.
- Added a Verbose Output option in case you want some extra details on what is going on. You probably don't care for this, and it is just there for some extra debugging info.
- Added a new Analyzer Mode. This doesn't do any processing on files, and just gets the average loudness of a set of CON files.
- Fixed a couple fields from not being disabled while the process is running.
- Fixed some parsing issues with attenuation values.
- Audio is no longer clipped at 0 dB in processing.

AUDIO ANALYZER
- Improved handling of audio files with 8 or less channels, should now display them correctly

STEMS ISOLATOR
- Improved handling of audio files with 8 or less channels, should no longer butcher the stems when extracting in those cases

FILE ANALYZER
- Added option to batch analyze and separate into a folder songs that are missing drum fills (EuroMIX Special)
- Added option to batch analyze and separate into folder songs that are missing overdrive markers on instruments charted (EuroMIX Special)

PACK CREATOR
- Fixed behavior where it would delete the contents of the 'input' folder when exiting

CON EXPLORER
- Added support for DJ Hero and DJ Hero 2 Xbox 360 files

GENERAL
- Updated SngCli to latest version, which in turn requires you to install .NET 8 Runtime if you don't already have it (you'll get a popup with a link to Microsoft's website if that's the case)
- Code changes as needed to accomodate new and different SngCli dependency

----------

v5.2.3

VISUALIZER
- Added two new fonts (Segoe UI and Verdana)
- Fixed behavior where it wouldn't remember the last font used - thanks to SonicSBL for raising this issue on Github
- Added control joystick so the release year can now be moved around to compensate for long album names + track numbers overlapping with the release year - thanks to SonicSBL for raising this issue on Github

BATCH RENAMER
- Added option to sort by author under Sorting Options - only works with individual/loose CONs, not packs

BATCH EXTRACTOR
- Addresses issue with extracting packs to YARG exCON format failing by telling you (in the log) if the file is a pack and skipping it, and going on to the next file... please use the Quick Pack Editor to dePACK the pack files or use Onyx to separate them, then run them through this tool
- Now says "Extracting files for song #x of y" as requested by Nyxyxylyth

PS3 CONVERTER
- Fixed issue where One-Click Batch PS3 Fixer pops up with notice after each song, interrupting the batch process, plus additional improvements to logging during this process

----------

v5.2.2

AUDIO CONVERTER
- Can now drag/drop multiple source files to each convert button and it'll process them in batch
- Changed behavior in the CLI version so converted files save to the original source folder rather than the fixed "Converted" folder in \bin- this makes more sense and allows additional features...
- When using the CLI version using one of the provided batch scripts, now it can be used to recursively search directories and subdirectories and it will convert all supported files found to the script format (i.e. Clone Hero folders can be copy/pasted into the _source_audio folder in \bin then run the batch script and all .opus files will be converted to .ogg, for example)

BATCH EXTRACTOR
- Added new feature to Extract to YARG "exCON" format as requested by the great Nyxyxylyth

PS3 CONVERTER
- Implemented Linos' request to have the One-Click Batch PS3 Fixer apply the alphanumeric song_id fix at the same time
- Fixed issue with "bad encryption masks" for certain old C3 customs - thanks to LocalH

BATCH RENAMER
- Added option to rename to (Year) The Artist - Song and (Year) Song - The Artist as requested by wkdbounce

BATCH PROCESSOR
- Added option to add (Year) to the song title in the DTA as requested by wkdbounce

FILE ANALYZER
- Fixed issue raised in Github by EafAtta where when batch analyzing files it would add on to the prior song's numbers so each song would have its numbers plus the prior song numbers, and so on and so forth

VOLUME NORMALIZER
- Merged pull request from SuperRiderTH with minor changes
- Modified SuperRiderTH's code to hopefully avoid scientific notation in the DTA files - issue raised by RazQ

CON EXPLORER
- Fixed bug introduced in v5.2.1 where it would crash when loading certain packs

MAIN FORM
- Fixed button visibility not saving across uses for certain buttons
- Fixed Character Editor button not having the correct context menu

----------

v5.2.1

CLONE HERO CONVERTER
- Removed YARG from the name since YARG can read CON files and converting is no longer necessary - removed PS from the name since virtually nobody is or should be using Phase Shift at this point
- Removed the "Send to Audacity" and "Do Nothing" options as they were not being used now that Nautilus can decrypt all Rock Band files
- Added option so when converting from Rock Band CON to Clone Hero folder it will convert the audio to .opus format for better quality and smaller file size than .ogg

CON EXPLORER
- Added ability to right click and rename a file within an existing CON file (experimental)
- Added ability to right click and rename a folder within an existing CON file (experimental)

CON CREATOR
- Disabled drag/drop of folders feature for being problematic - you can right click and add your folders that way very quickly - if you're doing a pack use Pack Creator instead of CON Creator

SAVE SCORES VIEWER
- Updated to v2.3 (thanks to StackOverflow0x)

MAIN FORM
- Updated web path to update file based on new domain name
- renamed YARG/CH/PS CONVERTER button to CLONE HERO CONVERTER

----------

v5.2.0

AUDIO CONVERTER (NEW FEATURE!)
- By popular request I have added the GUI component of Audio Converter to Nautilus - it will still depend on the CLI backend (comes included with Nautilus) but if I issue an update to the CLI app, all you have to do is drop it in the Nautilus /bin/ folder and you'll have an updated copy of Audio Converter, since it's likely that Nautilus and Audio Converter won't be synced at all times

VISUALIZER
- Added support for playing back Fortnite Festival folder structures using the custom .fnf or .ini metadata files and the original .m4a multitrack audio - either drag and drop the folder or the .m4a file (it's a little slow for now but it works)
- Added support for exporting Fortnite Festival songs as stereo audio files
- Added support for playing back PS3 folder structures so you can drag/drop a PS3 folder or you can send from File Indexer
- Added support for displaying song lyrics when playing back PS3 songs, both in folder structure and in PKG files
- Added support for displaying song lyrics when playing back Clone Hero and Fret Smasher songs that have a notes.mid file with PART VOCALS chart
- Added support for displaying song lyrics when playing back PowerGig songs - a little wonky but mostly works
- Added support for displaying song lyrics when playing back YARG songs
- Removed need to select exporting audio format first - now you can do it directly on the save screen and it'll use the right encoder based on your selection
- Removed old code that would assume the author was Harmonix based on the game source, since DX allows one to change that it's no longer semi-accurate like it was before
- Some code cleanup

STEMS ISOLATOR
- Added ability to import Fortnite Festival .m4a files and export to a stereo file
- Added ability to import Fortnite Festival .m4a files and isolate individual stems
- Added ability to export to FLAC, MP3 and OPUS formats on top of the existing OGG and WAV options

AUDIO ANALYZER
- Added support for analyzing Fortnite Festival .m4a files

CON EXPLORER
- Added ability to remove a file from the CON file / pack directly by right clicking and selecting "Delete selected file"

CON CREATOR
- Fixed CON Creator not making CON files correctly and having folders at the top instead of properly nested folders, among other fixes and improvements

FILE INDEXER
- Added support for scanning PS3 folders for .dta files

DTA PARSER
- Improved how it handles pans/vols/cores values that have unexpected tab delimiters, which was causing issues with some "RB4 to RB2" songs

WII CONVERTER
- Fixed behavior that should have been in place - now it only enables removing crowd tracks if downmixing drums is checked (it's needed for the process to work)

SETLIST EXPORTER (inside SETLIST MANAGER)
- Fixed issue that would happen with some computers that would crash the program when trying to create the PDF thumbnail due to problems with PDFLibNet.dll and missing Visual C++ 2010 dependency

BATCH PROCESSOR
- Changed behavior so when processing files it only replaces the song ID with a unique numeric ID if the existing ID was not already a numeric value (i.e. won't overwrite prior numeric IDs)

PS3 CONVERTER
- Changed behavior so when processing files it only replaces the song ID with a unique numeric ID if the existing ID was not already a numeric value (i.e. won't overwrite prior numeric IDs)

CHARACTER EDITOR
- Localized the import and export of prefab characters so people in other countries should no longer experience issues due to unexpected non-American formatting in values

MAIN FORM
- Enabled resizing of the form so user can fix it when it shrinks to only one button (still need to figure out why that happens)
- Rearranged some things to make space for Audio Converter

----------

v5.1.2

VISUALIZER
- Added ability to display the PART VOCALS lyrics in karaoke style, static style or scrolling style when PART VOCALS is available in the MIDI file
- Added option to choose between displaying the whole words or displaying game syl- la- bles when using either static or karaoke styles
- Added ability to display the song's track # when available in the DTA file
- Added message to let you know when your RS2014 .psarc file has '_p' in the file name as that breaks compatibility with the software Visualizer relies on to unpack those files
- Added ability to play RS2014 customs made for Mac systems (it could already play customs made for PC systems)

CON/RBA CONVERTER
- Added ability to convert from CON back to RBA format

PACK CREATOR
- Changed behavior so when changing to RB1, RB2 or RB3, both the Content and Package images display the same icon - you can still override either or both of them manually but this makes it easier for some users

SETLIST MANAGER
- Fixed compatibility issue where it would throw a bunch of errors if the Setlist file had a bugged out Clone Hero file with Track Number 65535 - now it loads the Setlist file correctly and assigns Track Number 1 to the problem file

----------


v5.1.1

YARG/CH/PS CONVERTER
- Added ability to decrypt and extract contents of YARG .yargsong files - click on "Tools -> Decrypt YARG yargsong files"

VISUALIZER
- Added support for YARG .yargsong files - just drag/drop and it'll play

SETLIST MANAGER
- Added ability to import PS4 songdta_ps4 files - you can either drag/drop one at time or drag a folder and let it search for all the songdta_ps4 files within that folder
- Added ability to import rbdxcache files - just drag/drop like a regular songcache file

PS3 SCANNER
- Improved scanning of DTA files in all subfolders

MIDI CLEANER
- Fixed issue where it would remove the percussion markers for Harm1, which would in turn break percussion showing up in game - thanks to Blackened15 for raising the issue

----------

v5.1.0

GENERAL
- Fixed many instances of broken compatibility with encrypted mogg files
- Removed all instances of mogg obfuscation as it is no longer needed

YARG/CH/PS CONVERTER
- Added ability to mark the converted song(s) to use a custom icon

ADVANCED ART CONVERTER
- Greatly expanded ability to convert .png_wii images to include more than 1,100 on-disc images plus album art as usual
- Added support for extracting textures from milo_wii files - you're on your own in converting the .tex files to a usable format (for now)

QUICK PACK EDITOR
- Fixed bug where songs with [ and ] in the name would cause an unhandled exception error

SETLIST MANAGER
- Made it so it's possible for the export versions and Blitz versions of Give It Away and Spoonman to be on the same Setlist at the same time

----------

v5.0.0

C3 TOOLS IS NOW NAUTILUS

GENERAL
- All tools can now openly work with encrypted audio (mogg) files from Rock Band 1 "(v11") to Rock Band 3 ("v16") and everything in between (all the games except The Beatles: Rock Band are supported, all official and RBN DLC are supported) - this means that you can analyze an encrypted mogg file using Audio Analyzer or File Analyzer, you can separate the stems of an encrypted mogg using Stems Isolator (must be inside of a CON since Stems Isolator relies on songs.dta information to separate stems), you can batch decrypt encrypted moggs (or CONs with encrypted moggs) using Batch Cryptor, you can play CONs with encrypted moggs in Visualizer, and possibly the most useful feature - you can now convert CONs with encrypted moggs to YARG / Clone Hero / Phase Shift use with separated stems instead of downmixing to stereo

FILE ANALYZER
AUDIO ANALYZER
BATCH CRYPTOR
- On top of the above, these three tools can now also analyze and decrypt Rock Band 4 and Rock Band 4 DLC ("v17") mogg files

VISUALIZER
- Added support for playing Rock Band 4 songs in PS4 format - just drag/drop the song's songdta_ps4 file to Visualizer
- Improved ability to display .png_ps4 album art - certain files would not work and would throw an error, should be fixed now - thanks to Onyxite for the help

SETLIST MANAGER
- Reworked a feature that only showed up while in Rock Band 4 mode with a Rock Band 4 setlist so it now shows up for all modes and all setlists, and renamed it so it's clear - Preloaded Setlists - just click to add whatever game's songs you're missing with one click
- Added preloaded setlist for The Beatles: Rock Band on-disc songs (44)
- Added preloaded setlist for The Beatles: Rock Band DLC songs (29)

ADVANCED ART CONVERTER
- Improved converting from .png_ps4 format - certain files would not work and would throw an error, should be fixed now - thanks to Onyxite for the help

OPEN SOURCE
- It's finally happening - if you're reading this, I have posted the source code to Nautilus on Github with everything you need to edit it and compile it yourself - https://github.com/trojannemo/Nautilus

----------

v4.8.4

MAIN FORM
- Added ability to show/hide the Mario head (for the Flappy Bird clone game) - go to Settings and click on Show/Hide Mario

PS3 CONVERTER
- Improved behavior by entirely replacing my code with RBEmmanced's code for generating unique numeric IDs - now the numeric IDs generated by the Tools should match RB3E's numeric IDs

CON EXPLORER
- Improved behavior by entirely replacing my code with RBEmmanced's code for generating unique numeric IDs - now the numeric IDs generated by the Tools should match RB3E's numeric IDs

BATCH PROCESSOR
- Fixed bug where it would overwrite an existing song_id that was already commented out instead of ignoring it

MOGG MAKER
- Fixed bug where it wouldn't clean up after itself when exiting

----------

v4.8.3

ADVANCED ART CONVERTER
- Added support for converting to and from .png_ps4 format

BATCH PROCESSOR (PREVIOUSLY BATCH DTA PROCESSOR)

VISUALIZER
- Added support for viewing .png_ps4 album art

CON EXPLORER
- Fixed bug where the description box was disabled and you couldn't change the text

BATCH CRYPTOR
- Fixed bug where encrypt button was invisible

MAIN FORM
- Fixed bug where when it would exit it would reset your customizations so they wouldn't save to the config file - should work fine now

----------

v4.8.2

CON EXPLORER
- Added ability to generate unique numeric ID using the same CRC32 code previously implemented for PS3 users - click on the Change ID button on the top right and then click Generate ID

SETLIST MANAGER
- Added ability to automatically add all song.ini files found within a folder by drag/dropping the folder to the form - now it looks for both songs.dta and song.ini files recursively and adds them automatically

PS3 CONVERTER
- Fixed bug where the "Batch fix looping songs" tool would fail on C3 encrypted songs

UPGRADE BUNDLER
- Fixed bug where songs with short versions would confuse the program - now it properly reads the long version of the song and gets the right MIDI file for it - if you want to mess around with the short version you need to do it manually sorry

----------

V4.8.1

VISUALIZER
- Added limited ability to Visualize BandFuse files - just drag and drop the DLC (LIVE) file and Visualizer will display the album art and play the multitrack audio - since it can't read (yet) the metadata for the song, Visualizer will make an educated guess at the artist and song title based on the header of the LIVE file - but it may make mistakes - tested working with 20 encrypted DLC files - if you have unencrypted BandFuse files or PS3 BandFuse files please contact me and send some my way for development - huge thanks to PikminGuts92 for making this happen with his updated songfuse tool
- Added ability to extract a downmixed stereo file out of the BandFuse CLT files  -> Click on Tools and enable the right option, then drag and drop your DLC (LIVE) file and follow the prompts
- Added ability to let you access the extracted multitrack files out of the BandFuse CLT files -> Click on Tools and enable the right option, then drag and drop your DLC (LIVE) file
- Added ability to extract a downmixed stereo file out of YARG yarg_mogg files -> Click on Tools and enable the right option, then drag and drop your YARG folder and follow the prompts
- Added ability to choose from five audio formats when exporting the stereo file - select your format from Tools - Audio Encoding Options (default and recommended is FLAC)
--- Please note that metadata (where available) is embedded into each output file as follows
----- FLAC - Artist, Title, Album, Year, Track Number, Genre, Album Art (image viewable in Windows and most applications)
----- MP3 - Artist, Title, Album, Year, Track Number, Genre, Album Art (image viewable in Windows and most applications)
----- OPUS - Artist, Title, Album, Year, Track Number, Genre, Album Art (only viewable in VLC Player and some applications - Windows refuses to read the metadata even though it's there)
----- OGG - Artist, Title, Album, Year, Track Number, Genre, NO Album Art
----- WAV - NO METADATA SUPPORTED
- Added support for reading preview_start_time tag in Clone Hero and similar games that use .ini files

PS3 CONVERTER
- Fixed bug in the looping song fix tool that would swap vocals and keys and vice versa in the resulting audio

GENERAL
- Changes to the Main Form to prevent resizing and make things more normalized

----------

V4.8.0

GENERAL
- Significant changes to the list of command line arguments supported by the Tools, both by adding new supported arguments as well as improving most of the existing ones
- To see a list of supported arguments either use c3tools -help on a Command Prompt or click Settings -> Help -> CLI help
- PRO TIP: Make shortcuts for your most used tools using the command line arguments in the Target property of your shortcut

MINI STUDIO (NEW FEATURE!)
- This tool allows you to feed it a mono or stereo track in either .ogg, .mp3 or .wav format and apply a variety of effects - after which you can play your edited track in Mini Studio or save to file in .WAV format
- Chorus, Echo, Reverb, Flanger, Distortion, Compression and Gargle effects and volume control are available with a multitude of settings to make sure you're never bored while experimenting
- You can save your settings for future use or to share with others by clicking the Export Preset button - you can import presets just as easily by clicking on the Import Preset button
- My goal was to automatically create a crowd track but I haven't been able to figure out the right settings to make it happen (if it's even possible) but it's still a cool tool and I figured some of you in music production might use it

STEMS ISOLATOR (NEW FEATURE!)
- This is technically not new, it's been a feature for almost 10 years, but it's been hidden. I'm releasing it now with some restrictions due to some comments and requests i've received
- This tool will only work with unencrypted or decrypted MOGG files
- Will take a single CON file (no packs) and will either extract to WAV or OGG format for each stem in the MOGG file
- Will take a single CON file (no packs) and will downmix to stereo WAV or OGG files applying the songs.dta attenuation and panning values to recreate the in-game sound
- Will take a single CON file (no packs) and will create a modified CON file with edited songs.dta file that will allow you to record stems from your Xbox 360 - this is an OLD feature that should NOT be used at this point but I'm leaving it for legacy purposes

VISUALIZER
- Added ability to Visualize GHWT:DE files - just drag and drop the song.ini file - works with both encrypted and unencrypted files - huge thanks to AddyMills for making this happen
- Added ability to extract a downmixed stereo MP3 file out of the GHWT:DE FSB files -> Click on Tools and enable the right option, then drag and drop your song.ini file and follow the prompts
- Added ability to let you access the extracted multitrack files out of the GHWT:DE FSB files -> Click on Tools and enable the right option, then drag and drop your song.ini file
- Added ability to force GHWT:DE files to show an album art image - just drop either album.jpg or album.png in the Content folder and it will be displayed along with the song's metadata - this is useful if you are extracting the downmixed stereo .mp3 file as that is tagged with ID3v2 and album art is included in the tag
- Added ability to Visualize Power Gig files - just drag and drop the XML file (both unencrypted and encrypted files work - for encrypted files you'll need a copy of Onyx CLI - just follow the prompts)
- Added ability to extract a downmixed stereo MP3 file out of the Power Gig XMA files -> Click on Tools and enable the right option, then drag and drop your XML file and follow the prompts
- Added ability to let you access the extracted multitrack files out of the Power Gig XMA files -> Click on Tools and enable the right option, then drag and drop your XML file
- Added ability to force Power Gig files to show an album art image - just drop either album.jpg or album.png in the same folder as the XML file and it will be displayed along with the song's metadata - this is useful if you are extracting the downmixed stereo .mp3 file as that is tagged with ID3v2 and album art is included in the tag
- Added ability to Visualize Fortnite Festival songs using the custom .fnf metadata file format and .opus audio - either one single song.opus multitrack file or individual drums/bass/guitar/vocals/song .opus tracks - original .m4a format is currently not supported so make sure the audio files are in .opus format
- Expanded INI compatibility so now it can properly Visualize Fret Smasher and Guitar Star songs - just drag and drop the song.ini file
- Fixed bug where some song.ini based songs would not display a song length and would not allow you to skip through the song as a result

PS3 CONVERTER
- Added tool to "Batch fix looping songs" - this is a complex process but it's fully automated and should fix all songs that loop at the end
- Removed "Fix PS3 mogg that causes looping" and "Fix looping when converting" since they weren't really doing anything
- Reworked "Batch replace song IDs" to now use RB3e's CRC32 code for generation of unique numeric IDs that would be consistent from user to user (based on the original alphanumeric ID) (thanks to Emma (IPG) for the original code)
- Removed menus and code for outdated generation of numeric IDs based on C3's system - use the new system!
- Removed Onyx nag screen on launch - now the message is displayed on the Log as well as if you click on the Onyx icon or the Onyx button
- Fixed bug where in the Linos Special Scenario 2 the audio would be improperly downmixed, affecting the resulting mogg file
- Fixed bug where it would always return false when checking if a mogg had already been patched

BATCH DTA PROCESSOR
- Added ability to batch replace song IDs with proper numeric IDs based on RB3E's CRC32 code
- Fixed bug where CON files with periods in the name would be ignored

MIDI CLEANER
- Will now also clean PART RHYTHM tracks (applies the same logic as to PART GUITAR and PART BASS)

FILE ANALYZER
- Will now ignore instrument parts labeled FNF, PLASTIC [INSTRUMENT], REAL DRUMS, etc - anything that isn't Rock Band standard - to avoid double counting notes for Rock Band charts

----------

v4.7.0 - 50K Edition

MOGG MAKER (NEW FEATURE!)
- Allows you to drag/drop .mp3/.ogg/.wav/.opus/.aiff/.flac/.m4a audio files to create a Mogg file for use with Rock Band games
- Allows you to add silent tracks so you can create a Rock Band compliant mogg even if you only have the backing audio
- Allows you to re-arrange the tracks - just click on the track you want to move and press Up or Down on your keyboard
- Allows you to delete a track if you added it by mistake - click on the track and press Delete on your keyboard
- Allows you to select encoding quality from -1 (very low) to 10 (very high) - default is 3 --- play at your own risk
- Allows you to override the audio frequency of the input files
- Allows you to encrypt the resulting Mogg file
- Allows you to automatically send the resulting Mogg file to Audio Analyzer to inspect the result

VISUALIZER
- Added ability to Visualize the new Clone Hero SNG files
- Added ability to Visualize Clone Hero songs in loose folder structure, including .opus and .ogg audio formats
- Added ability to Visualize Rocksmith 2014 PSARC files *** please note that the difficulty bubbles are an educated guess based on some file metadata, there is no clearly defined difficulty levels in Rocksmith
- Improved ability to Visualize YARG songs in extracted CON folder structure, now plays both *.yarg_mogg and *.mogg audio formats
- Fixed bug where Visualizer would fail to display DDS files
- Fixed bug that wasn't showing the chart author unless it was Visualizing an Xbox 360 CON file

YARG/CH/PS CONVERTER
- Added tool to batch decode folder of new Clone Hero SNG files
- Added option to convert SNG .opus audio files to .ogg format during decoding

PS3 CONVERTER
- Added One-Click Batch PS3 Fixer a/k/a The Linos Special tool - click on it for a description of what it does
- Fixed bug where it would fail when converting from PS3 folder to CON if the PS3 folder had the word "ps3" in the file path

BATCH DTA PROCESSOR
- Added ability to batch replace the vocal_gender value
- Added ability to specify "fallback" game_origin value for advanced users

QUICK PACK EDITOR
- Added option (under Advanced) to select signing the resulting pack as CON or LIVE

WII CONVERTER
- Fixed bug where it would list 22500Hz as a rate option instead of 22050Hz

ADVANCED ART CONVERTER
- Fixed bug where intermediary DDS files created when converting from Xbox/PS3 format would not have their mipmaps due to incorrect DDS header

BATCH EXTRACTOR
- Fixed bug where it would throw an error upon loading the previously used folder

PACK CREATOR
- Fixed a few graphical bugs

----------

v4.6.6

SETLIST MANAGER
- Fixed broken importing of YARG or Clone Hero JSON files due to an unknown bug in Path.GetFileName, using workaround that should work - reminder that valid file names are "yarg.json" "ch.json" or "clonehero.json"
- Fixed compatibility that would break importing of YARG or Clone Hero JSON files for certain songs that had more than just the year in the year field (i.e. Beatles "Year": "1967 (November 24)")

----------

v4.6.5

VISUALIZER
- Added ability to Visualize PS3 PKG files

FILE ANALYZER
- Added ability to analyze PS3 PKG files

AUDIO ANALYZER
- Added ability to view and analyze mogg files in PS3 PKG files

PS3 CONVERTER
- Added ability to process PKG packs into single CONs (before would only work with single PKGs)
- Fixed bug that would "patch" mogg files that would not need it

BATCH DTA PROCESSOR
- Added ability to batch replace the author name in the DTA files with any value the user enters
- Changed behavior to search recursively for CON files in nested folder structure

BATCH CRYPTOR
- Fixed bug that would apply PS3 patch to files that would not need it, leading to corrupt mogg files

----------

v4.6.4

BATCH DTA PROCESSOR
- Fixed small bug related to how the game_origin value was being written to the DTA file

SETLIST MANAGER
- Fixed bug where importing songs from 2020+ would be read as 0 or blank - unfortunately you'll need to re-import your affected songs since the data was never saved to the setlist the first time around

PACK CREATOR
- Added RB1/RB2/RB3 buttons at top to quickly change game ID without having to navigate through the Advanced menu
- Fixed graphic bug that was cutting off the right margin

CON CREATOR
- Fixed bug that would not allow you to add files to selected folder and instead would add them to the Root folder - this is particularly useful if packaging a bunch of pro upgrades for example: manually add the songs_upgrades folder (right click on the left panel and add folder), make sure that folder is clicked, and drag and drop all your upgrades on the right side - done!

YARG/CH/PS CONVERTER
- Fixed bug introduced in v4.6.0 where the quality setting was being ignored

----------

v4.6.3

FILE ANALYZER
- Now scans for PS/CH/YARG Expert+ 2x Bass Pedal notes during file analysis
- Fixed small bug where individual MIDI files would not be processed, only CON files would
- Fixed bug where toms would not be counted correctly

----------

v4.6.2

GENERAL
- Every instance of a folder browsing dialog has now been replaced with a much more modern version thanks to Onyxite pointing out the FolderPicker class by Simon Mourier - it should be a one-to-one seamless replacement so I don't anticipate issues but if you experience any problems please let me know

FILE ANALYZER
- Fixed bugs introduced when added batch processing so now it should accept a file as an argument so you can launch it by drag/dropping a file over the File Analyzer button - this also fixes other related bugs

----------

v4.6.1

WII CONVERTER
- Fixed bug where sometimes crowd and backing tracks would end up blank after downmixing

PS3 CONVERTER
- Fixed bug where sometimes crowd and backing tracks would end up blank after downmixing

----------

v4.6.0

NOTE: C3 TOOLS HAS MIGRATED FROM NET FRAMEWORK 4.0 TO 4.8.1. ALSO ALL AUDIO PROCESSING AND ENCODING DEPENDENCIES WERE UPDATED TO MOST RECENT (BASS, BASS.NET, BASS ADD-ONS, NO LONGER RELYING ON OGGENC2). NOTHING SHOULD CHANGE FOR YOU BUT IF YOU NOTICE ANYTHING WEIRD OR BROKEN PLEASE LET ME KNOW ASAP.

RB3 CHARACTER EDITOR
- Almost entire rewrite of the code - the original code made incorrect assumptions about character genders and changing genders in the Editor would lead to weird behavior in game or crashing. REMOVED ability to change gender and rewrote how most of the Editor works to now better edit, save, import and export characters with less problems in game. You just need to make sure the character you're editing matches the gender of the clothes and accessories you're assigning to it (they're now labeled (F) and (M)). Likewise only import prefab characters into a character of the same gender to avoid issues.
- Added support for PS3 save.dat files (only unencrypted files from RPCS3, sorry) 
- Can now export your custom character to a .prefab file, and can then import that .prefab file into another save file - the import/export can be done from Xbox 360 band3 <-> PS3 save.dat
- Fixed bug where offset for character 8 was wrong so it would never load
- Added some color to the program since it was so bland

WII CONVERTER
- Code improvements and changes needed to make it work with The Beatles: Rock Band customs - it will now accept TBRB custom songs that have unencrypted or C3 encrypted audio (nothing with official TBRB audio will work)
- Added ability to select sample rate for preview audio
- Changed behavior so preview audio won't have crowd track present
- Changed behavior so it will always downmix drums if more than 2 drum channels regardless of total channels in the mogg
- Slight improvement to start time of auto created preview mogg
- Fixed bug / compatibility issue when downmixing certain songs that had mono tracks
- Fixed bug caused by oggenc2 when downmixing songs with 8 or less channels - no longer relying on oggenc2

PS3 CONVERTER
- Code improvements and changes needed to make it work with The Beatles: Rock Band customs - it will now accept TBRB custom songs that have unencrypted or C3 encrypted audio (nothing with official TBRB audio will work)
- Fixed bug / compatibility issue when downmixing certain songs that had mono tracks
- Fixed bug caused by oggenc2 when downmixing songs with 8 or less channels - no longer relying on oggenc2

YARG/CH/PS CONVERTER
- Code improvements and changes needed to make it work with The Beatles: Rock Band customs - it will now accept TBRB custom songs that have unencrypted or C3 encrypted audio (nothing with official TBRB audio will work)

DTA PARSER
- Added/fixed compatibility with songs that have long and short versions within the same CON file - now it reads the long version (sorry not going to add support for choosing which version it reads, so we're defaulting to long version) and this means Visualizer plays the correct audio, the Converters use the right audio and MIDI file, etc

FLAPPY C3
- Performance improvements

GENERAL
- Fixed (apparently?) longstanding bug with audio processing code that may have been applying wrong vols and pans for songs with 8 or less channels

----------

v4.5.0

RB3 CHARACTER EDITOR (NEW FEATURE!)
- Thanks to Lord Zedd\TehBanStick's generosity, as well as requests I received, RB3 Character Editor (formerly known simply as RB3Tool) joins C3 Tools
- (In theory) now you can resign the save game file from within the program -> Click on the Exit button then select Yes when prompted - please notify me if this doesn't work as intended
- Drag/drop is now enabled - just drag your band3 file to the main form and it'll auto-load
- Many cosmetic changes implemented (all buttons have hand cursors, the form is centered on screen, added Exit button, all message boxes were reworked to be more informational and look better, etc)
- Under the hood changes that were necessary since the Xceed WPF library that was used previously was no longer viable so I had to compile my own from Github

BATCH CRYPTOR (NEW FEATURE!)
- This tool allows you to batch encrypt loose moggs and moggs within CONs - resulting moggs are PS3 friendly and ready to be used without additional patching or re-encrypting like before

PS3 CONVERTER
- Added menu option to patch an individual mogg file for PS3 use - click on Tools -> Patch mogg for PS3 use and then select the mogg to be patched
- Improved behavior so now it can distinguish between batch folders of C3 PS3 files with their static klic and RPCS3 folders of extracted Onyx PKG files with their dynamic klic and will work with both (plus still works with PKG files)
- Fixed bug when downmixing and reencoding to quality 3 where it would mess up the instrument ranks/difficulties if an instrument was missing from the tracks section - thanks to Linos for pointing it out and troubleshooting
- Fixed bug where it would fail to convert if the file path had ps3 in the name - thanks to GeeForce11 for pointing it out and always helping troubleshoot
- Improved behavior and stability when patching moggs for PS3 use (mostly under the hood work that you won't notice)

SETLIST MANAGER
- Added ability to recursively search for all songs.dta files and load them into your .setlist file - this is mainly useful for RPCS3 users but i'm sure others might find a use for it too

FILE INDEXER
- Added option to export displayed songs to Json format (right click on the window)

----------

v4.4.1

GENERAL
- Improvements to mogg encryption that should now allow encrypted Xbox 360 moggs to work directly on PS3 without needing any additional decryption/encryption. Pair this with Onyx's Quick Convert for a better Xbox 360 to PS3 experience - infinite thanks to LocalH for his assistance with this

SETLIST MANAGER
- Added support for importing YARG songs export .json files. To do this open YARG, go to Settings, in the General tab click on Export Songs List (For Ouvert Bot), choose a folder and click Save for the songs.json file to be exported. IMPORTANT: rename it to yarg.json since both YARG and Clone Hero export songs.json files. Drag and drop that yarg.json file to Setlist Manager and it'll do the rest for you. For now this is limited because YARG only exports so much data compared to RB3. Feel free to request additional data be added to the .json export and I'll add support
- Added support for importing Clone Hero songs export .json files. To do this open Clone Hero, log into a profile, go to Settings, in the General tab go down to and click on Export Song List (Json). It will look like nothing happened but you're good. Exit Clone Hero and go to My Documents\Clone Hero. You should find a songs.json file there. IMPORTANT: rename it to ch.json since both YARG and Clone Hero export songs.json files. Drag and drop that ch.json file to Setlist Manager and it'll do the rest for you. For now this is limited because Clone Hero only exports so much data compared to RB3. Feel free to request additional data be added to the .json export and I'll add support

PS3 CONVERTER
- Added feature to go from PS3 folder structure (one or multiple) to Xbox 360 CON in one click -> click on PS3 to CON then Batch convert PS3 song folder(s) to CON. Select the folder where you have your PS3 folder or folders you want to convert to CON and let it do the rest
- Added feature to go from Onyx PS3 PKG files (one or multiple) to Xbox 360 CON in one click -> click on PS3 to CON then Batch convert PS3 PKG to CON. Select the folder where you have your PKG file(s) and let it go to work - you can also drag/drop one or multiple PKG files to PS3 Converter and it'll automatically convert the file(s) to CON

PHASE SHIFT CONVERTER (now YARG/CH/PS CONVERTER)
- Minor changes to behavior to better fit use in 2023

----------

v4.4.0

WII CONVERTER
- Added option (find it under Options menu) to automatically downmix drum tracks with more than two channels to a stereo drum track during the conversion process. If you enable this option, you also have the option (enabled by default) to delete the crowd track if present in the mogg file. The resulting file is encoded in quality 3 as requested by many to have a lower bitrate that should reduce file size and reduce stuttering in game. The resulting ogg file has a proper mogg header added thanks to maxton's makemogg tool. The songs.dta file is also edited during this process to reflect the changes made to the audio file. The MIDI file is also edited during this process to reflect the correct drum mixes for a stereo drum track. In theory, this should eliminate all the stuttering issues that Wii players were experiencing - many thanks to r0bd0g for his assistance with this
- Changed behavior when creating preview audio file to properly add a mogg header using maxton's makemogg tool rather than using the faked mogg header we've been using all these years

PS3 CONVERTER
- This tool is now officially deprecated in favor of Onyx Tool Suite since that tool can do a significantly better job at creating PS3 customs. However...
- Added tool (find it under the Tools menu on the left) to automatically downmix drum tracks to stereo to avoid going over the problematic 16 channel limit. This process will also encode the audio at quality 3 which should eliminate stuttering in game. This process will also encrypt the mogg file as required by the PS3. The songs.dta file is also edited during this process to reflect the changes made to the audio file. The MIDI file is also edited during this process to reflect the correct drum mixes for a stereo drum track. Use it by selecting the folder where your CON files are, it'll do the work and leave you with modified CONs that you feed to Onyx's Quick Convert feature. For safety, each modified CON will have a _backup copy made - many thanks to Linos for his assistance with this

FILE ANALYZER
- Fixed bug where some C3 encrypted and obfuscated mogg files could not be analyzed

----------

v4.3.2b

Hotfix to address two minor issues with VIDEO PREPARER and one minor issue with PACK CREATOR. You probably don't need to get this update.

----------

v4.3.2

CON CREATOR
- Added support for creating Dance Central, Dance Central 2, and Dance Central 3 files - this is EXPERIMENTAL as I have no way to test - let me know what works and what doesn't
- Fixed bug that would not allow user to create a pack because all files that should go to each song's gen folder would go to the first song's gen folder

RBtoUSB
- Now includes clean copy of Title Update 5 (TU5) and can be copied with one click in the menu. This is useful for anyone with a modified console who wants to play RB3 Enhanced (RB3E). NOT NEEDED if you play RB3DX or both RB3DX and RB3E combined.

PACK CREATOR
- Now has option to search recursively in a folder structure rather than you having to have all the songs on the same level (enabled by default)

VIDEO PREPARER
- Now has option to search recursively in a folder structure rather than you having to have all the songs on the same level (enabled by default)
- Fixed bug that would mess up some DTAs resulting in a missing closing bracket and all hell breaking loose
- Changed some default behaviors to better accomodate usage of this Tool in 2023 (I'm looking at you Fat Halpert)

PHASE SHIFT CONVERTER
- Fixed bug where you couldn't increase audio quality unless you first clicked down to lower audio quality

----------

v4.3.1

VISUALIZER
- Added support for YARG song files - just drag and drop the song folder onto Visualizer and it'll work like if it was a CON file

FILE ANALYZER
- Added support for yarg_mogg files

AUDIO ANALYZER
- Added support for yarg_mogg files

BATCH DTA PROCESSOR
- Fixed minor bug that would result in genre line being added twice

DTA PARSER
- Fixed small bug where sometimes there would be an error processing the keys audio tracks

----------

v4.3.0

MILOMOD (NEW FEATURE!)
- StackOverflow0x's tool to convert RBN2 MIDI venues to Milo venues joins C3 Tools - going forward it will be shipped with C3 Tools but can still be updated separately if Stack issues an update before I do - for any questions on functionality or support please hit up StackOverflow0x or let me know and I'll pass it along

RB3 SAVE SCORES VIEWER (NEW FEATURE!)
- StackOverflow0x's tool to view and edit scores in Rock Band 3 save files for Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii joins C3 Tools - going forward it will be shipped with C3 Tools but can still be updated separately if Stack issues an update before I do - for any questions on functionality or support please hit up StackOverflow0x or let me know and I'll pass it along

FLAPPY C3 (NEW FEATURE!)
- Ported over my old Flappy C3 "game" right into the main C3 Tools form - just click on the icon on the bottom left and then click click click like the original game. This "game" is fully customizable - see the \res\flappy\ folder for the three themes that are included and for an idea on how to make your own

SAVE FILE IMAGE EXTRACTOR (NOW SAVE FILE IMAGE EDITOR)
- I think I finally fixed the bug with saving changes to the Xbox 360 band3 file - you should now be able to edit and save without problems
- Fixed bug where when exporting composite character image, the buttons would be visible on the resulting image

FILE ANALYZER
- Can now batch analyze CON, MIDI, MOGG, PNG_XBOX and PNG_PS3 files - just drag and drop multiple files to the form instead of one by one like before

CON EXPLORER
- Reworked design and code so now it should correctly detect CON/LIVE/INSTALLER(TU)/OTHER file type and will save changes to the correct file type instead of defaulting to CON when it didn't recognize the file type (i.e. with TU files) - as a result you can no longer convert from CON to LIVE or LIVE to CON from within this tool - use CON/RBA Converter tool for that
- Can now easily extract or replace the .milo_xbox file without having to navigate through the contents structure of the CON file
- Added option to Inject file along with existing option to Replace file - if when using Replace you get a corrupted file (like with TU files), try using Inject and it may give you a different result

----------

v4.2.0

BATCH DTA PROCESSOR (NEW FEATURE!)
- Allows you to batch process CON files to edit their DTA files. For now the two features added as requested were the option to batch replace the game_origin value with a custom value (user enters it) and the option to move the Song Author value that Magma: C3 embeds in the DTA file but is not accessible from within the game into the DTA array proper. This will allow mods like RB3 Deluxe to read and display the Song Author in game, plus i'm sure other cool features can be developed with this.
- Also allows you to batch separate bundled DTA files into their component DTA files using the menu button for that feature

RBA EDITOR (beta) (NEW FEATURE!)
- Allows you to extract the contents of RBA/RBS files, replace them with modified versions, and recompile the RBA/RBS file - feel free to play around with drag/dropping into each button and right clicking on the buttons to see what you can do with each component file
- This is in Beta stage because I have no way to test the resulting RBA/RBS files - in theory they work but I need feedback from people with access to Audition Mode or another way to play with these files

QUICK PACK EDITOR
- Added feature to extract a single song from a pack - simply select the song in the list and click "Extract selected"

ADVANCED ART CONVERTER
- Now supports saving to DXT1 format for reduced file size - find the option in Advanced -> Texture Type. Still defaults to DXT5 for better image quality but if you're trying to optimize file sizes, DXT1 should be your choice.

VOLUME NORMALIZER
- Now parses some atypical CON volume levels correctly, and cleans up folders after failures
- Thanks to SuperRiderTH for continuing to maintain this tool, which he created and graciously "donated" to be part of C3 Tools

SETLIST MANAGER
- Added option to export unique songs when merging a .setlist file with an existing .setlist file - just follow the prompts and you end up with a text file with the unique songs listed so you can figure out why they're missing from your setlist (first load the smaller .setlist then load the larger .setlist, won't work the other way)
- Fixed nasty bug where if you had an open .setlist file and tried to import a cache/vff file, it would corrupt your open .setlist file and save it

CON EXPLORER
- Added better compatibility for Dance Central 1, 2 and 3 files so the game IDs are not butchered and the files should now be able to be modified and keep their correct game IDs

SONG ANALYZER (NOW FILE ANALYZER)
- Renamed tool since it does a lot more analyzing of component files than just analyzing song files - no other change

CON CONVERTER (NOW CON/RBA CONVERTER)
- Renamed tool to make it clearer what it does since it also converts RBA/RBS files to CON format, as well as batch converting CON <-> LIVE

----------

v4.1.1

VARIOUS TOOLS

SETLIST MANAGER
- Added ability to export setlist to JSON format for use with websites and similar applications

----------

v4.1.0

GENERAL
- NAME CHANGE! For many years this tool suite has done more than work with CON files, so I'm dropping the CON from the name and just calling it C3 Tools going forward
- Few quality-of-life fixes that you probably won't notice but were necessary
- All links to www.customscreators.com now point to https://rhythmgamingworld.com/

CON CREATOR
- Added ability to create The Beatles: Rock Band packages (inspired by the work done by FujiSkunk while I was gone)
- Changed behavior so Content Image and Package Image default to be the same, which makes more sense than prior behavior - can still force them to be different if you want

SONG ANALYZER
- Modified behavior for 'Batch analyze for unpitched vocals' so now it only identifies songs that are 75% or more unpitched vocals (should reduce false positives)

- Fixed bug in analysis of songs that would not count unpitched vocals using ^ in Harmonies

PHASE SHIFT CONVERTER
- Ability to specify encoding quality (1-10, default 5) is back as requested - applies both when splitting stems (if not encrypted) and when downmixing to stereo (always possible)

- Other minor behavior improvements

VISUALIZER
- Fixed bug that prevented you from hiding icons once assigned - right-click the icon for option to remove
- Fixed behavior so when moving an icon from left to right, or right to left, the other icon is moved to the other spot, rather than old behavior that deleted the other icon

- Allows you to simply drag/drop CON, LIVE, Title Update, game save or configuration files to the program and it sorts where the files need to go - users accidentally adding compressed archives (RAR/ZIP files) don't need to worry - RBtoUSB will extract the archive for you and add the files inside
- Allows you to view all important file information as well as song metadata right from the program without needing to first extract the files
- Interfaces with most of C3 CON Tools' other feature sets so you can send the file to Visualizer, Song Analyzer, CON Explorer, etc without needing to extract first for real time access to the files

----------

v2.7.0
ADVANCED ART CONVERTER
- Given all the recently and newly added (see below) features, it's no longer appropriate to call it "Album Art Converter", so renamed it
- Added ability to extract textures from your Rock Band 3 save game file. Drag and drop the file to Advanced Art Converter. Bam. Instantly get your character pictures as well as custom art you have created in the game's art creator
- Added support for more texture types and expanded support to all Rock Band games and expansion packs, the Rock Band music store app, and all Dance Central games
- Added ability to copy the current folder to directory or paste a directory to search in. Just right-click on the folder text box at the top
- Added feature that will remember last directory used and default to it if it still exists next time you run the program
- Fixed bug that would cause all images to be shifted slightly to the right
- Greatly reduced and improved the code for higher efficiency and accuracy in the conversion process

SAVE FILE IMAGE VIEWER (NEW!)
- Found in Advanced Art Editor -> Advanced
- Allows you to view your character pictures as well as custom art you have created in the game's art creator
- All three consoles are supported - see HELP doc for more information
- You can export all images by going to File -> Export all images or by clicking on the respective image's Export image button
- Five backgrounds are included for your character. If you want to change them, replace "bg1.png", "bg2.png", "bg3.png", "bg4.png" or "bg5.png" in the /res folder. To export a composite image of your character on the selected background, right click and choose "Export composite image"
- The code for editing and replacing of images is there, but disabled since the game continues to say the file is corrupt. Hopefully someone else can pick up where I left off and finish it. For now, EDITING IS DISABLED. ONLY VIEWING/EXTRACTING IS ENABLED.

SETLIST MANAGER
- Added support for Rock Band Blitz song cache files ("Library Files") - Xbox 360 ONLY (not quite sure if PS3 has a cache for it)
- To import a Blitz cache, go to File -> Import RB Blitz song cache. You can also add "blitz" to the name of the cache file and then drag and drop it. If you try drag/drop without having "blitz" in the filename it will fail, since it will assume it's a RB3 cache file
- There are some limitations: Blitz does not keep track of a few fields that RB3 does, so we don't have gender (defaults to Male), master status (defaults to being a master), song length (will show as 0:00), rating (defaults to NR), track number (defaults to 1)
- Fixed a couple of potential bugs for more stability

PACK EXPLORER
- Fixed bug introduced when this tool was strictly for Rock Band use which would change the game ID of any CON file opened to Rock Band 3 by default if it wasn't another Rock Band title - now can open, edit and save CON/LIVE files from other games without affecting the game ID
- Made the Visualize button only show up when the program can find a songs.dta file in the CON, otherwise it's not a Rock Band song and can't be Visualized

WII CONVERTER
- Fixed bug that would create a corrupt VENUE track, which in turn would cause playability issues with some songs
- Added option to enable/disable the conversion of the venue from RBN2 to RBN1 (enabled by default)
- Added option to enable/disable the conversion of post processing events (enabled by default)

VISUALIZER
- One more bug fix for using our default font. It was requiring you had Myriad Pro default installed, not just the included Myriad Pro Bold. Fixed

GENERAL
- Fixed behavior throughout to avoid issues of files being in use when the program scans for CON files

----------

v2.6.1
PS3 CONVERTER
- Changed method used to make the EDAT files to a more reliable and efficient tool = less failures, more consistency, less clutter

VISUALIZER
- Added option to pick between Myriad Pro (default), Calibri, Tahoma and Times New Roman fonts
- Changed behavior when our default font is not installed or accessible = program will keep running and you can just choose a different font
- Simplified ability to use a custom font = create a text file named font.txt and place it in the /res folder. Enter one line of text that says FontName=Name Here and save it. Visualizer will load that and make it default, but you can still choose any of the other fonts mentioned above. Make sure the font name is spelled correctly (case sensitive) and is actually installed on your system.

MIDI CLEANER
- Fixed multi-threading call bug that would cause the program to fail (introduced in v2.5.1)

- Fixed bug when changing how to name the files, settings would seem to change randomly

PACK CREATOR
- Added several new package thumbnails from RB3 and TB:RB textures

MAIN FORM
- Added ability to make form background transparent. Combine it with borderless and hide the banner = free-floating buttons!

----------

v2.6.0
- Since it's been brought up so many times and the program no longer resembled Le Fluffie in any way, we've renamed to C3 CON Tools. 
MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE YOUR SHORTCUTS TO POINT TO C3CONTools.exe! That includes changing the path in Magma: C3 Roks Edition under ADVANCED SETTINGS.

PS3 CONVERTER (NEW!)
- Customs come to PS3! (Requires jailbroken PS3, see included Help Documentation)
- Allows you to very quickly batch convert CON/LIVE files into PS3 format
- Allows you to merge already-converted songs with your existing customs (i.e. files downloaded from C3's database)

ALBUM ART CONVERTER
- Increased in-game album art quality exponentially (about 8x the image data) - now creates 512x512 DXT5 textures instead of prior 256x256 DXT1 textures when converting to png_xbox or png_ps3 
--- As of this writing, Magma: C3 Roks Edition isn't updated to accept these files natively. Refer to the updated tutorial on the Magma: C3 Roks Edition thread on how to get these higher quality album art files into your song
- Increased quality of images converted from png_xbox/png_ps3 (also noticeable in Visualizer)
- Added support for most Rock Band game textures (besides the usual album art files) - can be converted from *.png_xbox or *.png_ps3 to *.png, *.bmp, *.jpg and/or *.dds. No guarantees are made that it will work with all game textures from all Rock Band games, but over 3,000 textures from RB3 and TB:RB have been tested and worked
- Added support for input images in Targa format (*.tga)
- Removed ability to resize images on the fly when converting from png_xbox/png_ps3/png_wii - this yielded lower quality than doing so afterwards on Paint.NET or Photoshop, and allows for otherwise overall better quality as mentioned above

SETLIST MANAGER
- Fixed bug caused by old songs having Track Number 0 that would cause the Information panel to stop showing song information
- Fixed bug where certain songs would have ridiculous rating numbers that would cause the program to crash
- Fixed bug where files would not refresh when drag/dropping one Setlist after having another Setlist already opened
- Greatly improved error handling and notification during loading of the Setlists

QUICK PACK EDITOR
- Added ability to work with loose DTA files without requiring it to be in a pack

QUICK DTA EDITOR

BATCH EXTRACTOR
- Fixed bug that had broken ability to use with Pro Upgrade CONs

MAIN FORM
- Re-designed the layout to account for all the latest additions
- Added ability to fully customize your experience = resize the form to your liking; make the form be borderless; right-click on the background to choose a custom background color or use a custom background image (or drag and drop the image to the form); right-click on any button to change the background color and the text color of the button; right-click on the C3 banner to make transparent or hide. All of these changes will be saved and will be there next time you run the program. If you want to share your customization, just share the main.config file found under the /bin folder. Your friend can replace his or just drag and drop it to the program
- Right-click on the background and select "Reset everything..." to put everything back to stock

----------

v2.5.1
SETLIST MANAGER
- Enabled selecting of multiple songs in the song list for deleting - hold Control + click, or hold Shift + up/down arrow to select up or down

----------

v2.5.0
SETLIST MANAGER (NEW!)

- Gives you a multitude of detailed filtering and sorting options
- Can edit existing songs, delete existing songs, and add new songs

ALBUM ART CONVERTER
- Added "_keep" to the filename automatically when converting to *.png_xbox / *.png_ps3

GENERAL

- Patched up potential memory leak when sending MIDI files to midishrink (and includes fixed midishrink.exe thanks to raynebc)
- Improved how moving of files works throughout the program for better performance and lower likelihood of crashes

----------

v2.4.4c

----------

v2.4.4
QUICK PACK EDITOR
- Added option to dePACK packs into individual songs with one click. Each CON file will retain the same game ID as the original pack (i.e. RB1/RB2/RB3) and will be named Artist - Song. By default the CON files will use the song's album art file as thumbnail, user can change this to use the pack's thumbnail image.

MIDI CLEANER
- Expanded ability to clean CON/LIVE files. Same behavior as before - drag/drop one or multiple CON/LIVE files or use the "Browse..." button to find them. Can only combine CON/LIVE files with MIDI files. LIVE files will be changed to CON and unlocked/made anonymous in the process. No packs or pro upgrades.

- Expanded persistent options to include whether to override note velocities, the note velocity value, whether to correct notes that are too short, and what size to change them to

VISUALIZER
- Added support for PS3 (*.png_ps3) images for album art
- Changed behavior when reading the MIDI file to estimate if the file is Expert-Only. If the program determines it most likely is Expert-Only, you'll be shown why it thinks so and you can choose whether to mark is as Expert-Only or not. Songs marked as Expert-Only through Magma: C3 Roks Edition will continue to behave as they have in the past.
- Changed location of difficulty tier form to be centered on Visualizer's location rather than centered on the screen
- Fixed bug that would require pressing on Harmony image twice to change from one-part harmony to two-part harmony

GENERAL
- Improved code in all instances where CON/DTA files are imported/processed to expand compatibility with RB1 era files

----------

v2.4.1
MIDI CLEANER
- Added finding and moving of [music_start] event if it's earlier than two beats from the start of the track
- Added option (enabled by default) to create a BEAT track for the MIDI if one is not present already - this is highly accurate for most songs, but it may fail if there are irregularities in the MIDI file (i.e. very rare but possible, mostly very old files) - songs with 11/16 and similarly "weird" time signatures may need thinning of the BEAT track to match the "feel" of the song
- Added cleaning of lyrics with either # ^ & markers at the start of the lyric, now will be moved to the proper placement (as the last character of the lyric)
- Added option to display total number of issues fixed broken down by instruments (on by default when Detailed Logging is enabled)
- Greatly improved reporting accuracy when using [M:B:T] format during detailed logging (i.e. easier to find the problems in REAPER)
- Fixed code to ensure all tracks finish with an EndTrack event (just for a healthier MIDI file, no changes in behavior for RB3 purposes)
- Adjusted code so a "clean" copy isn't exported when nothing is actually cleaned in the MIDI
- Fixed bug that would not save clean MIDI to the right directory if MIDI Cleaner was opened via command-line or Magma
- Fixed bug that would sometimes report wrong notes twice when the MIDI was using running status
- Fixed bug that would report the uncapitalized lyrics without specifying the track name

WII CONVERTER
- Added code to convert unsupported RBN2 venues into supported RBN1 venues = working camera cuts and lighting calls! 
- This takes place automatically when converting an existing CON to Wii format, or you can click on 'Extras' -> 'Convert VENUE from RBN2 to RBN1' and you can process MIDI files for songs you've already converted. You can do one or multiple MIDI files at a time this way.

BATCH RENAMER
- Added option (enabled by default) to sort expert only songs separately when "Try detailed sub-sorting" is enabled. For songs created with Magma: C3 Roks Edition this is picked up from the DTA file. For other songs this is estimated based on the charts found in the MIDI file.

BATCH EXTRACTOR (previously DTA EXTRACTOR)
- Expanded from only extraction of DTA files to include MIDI, MOGG and MILO_XBOX files
- Can extract one or all of the file types above from one or multiple CON/LIVE files at once
- Still uses all the renaming features present before, each file type is grouped in its own folder
- For PNG_XBOX (album art) files, continue to use ALBUM ART EXTRACTOR

PACK CREATOR
- Several bug fixes and code changes to eliminate (or at least reduce) the "access to folder denied" errors reported that would cause the process to fail

PRO UPGRADE BUNDLER
- Added some code to improve loading of some MIDI files that may not have loaded before due to format errors

GENERAL

- MIDI Cleaner will NOT make an old RB/GH/FoF/PhaseShift MIDI ready to compile in Magma, but it will reduce a lot of the time you have to spend cleaning it up.
- MIDI Cleaner can be opened via command-line two ways: use -cleaner as an argument to open MIDI Cleaner, or use the file path to a specific MIDI file to open it automatically. This also means you can do Right-Click -> Open With and select C3 CON Tools
- For the extensive list of features included refer to the Help in MIDI Cleaner

QUICK PACK EDITOR (NEW!)
- Finally one of the most requested features is here! This allows you to quickly modify a pack of songs in two ways:
You drag and drop or browse for a pack, the program reads it, shows you all the songs it finds. Select all the songs you want to remove, leaving the ones you want to keep in the new package. Don't worry, you have plenty of opportunity to change your mind. Then you choose
1) Edit DTA entries only - the songs will be removed from the songs.dta file, so in game they will no longer show up. This is much quicker but leaves you with the same file size pack
2) Edit DTA entries and pack contents (default) - will remove the songs from the songs.dta file as well the associated files in the package. This is the preferred method but takes considerably longer
- If you want to go a little further, you can also change the title and description text, the package and content thumbnails (what you see in this program and the Xbox dashboard), and the game ID in case you want to change it (default value is whatever game ID the input file had)

QUICK DTA EDITOR (NEW!)
- Feature to quickly open and edit the DTA file (controls all metadata in the song)
- Drag and drop a song/pack file, or use the 'Open file' menu option. The DTA file is automatically extracted and opened in Notepad, you make your changes, exit out and click Yes to save. The modified DTA file is replaced and the song/pack file is saved as a signed, unlocked CON file ready for your Xbox

VISUALIZER
- Added option to use custom overlays for holidays and other special moments. You need two files, one called "theme_overlay.png" and one called "theme_button.png" - replace "theme" with the name of your holiday or whatever you want. Place those two in the /res folder. Visualizer includes six preset themes: Christmas ("xmas"), Valentine's Day ("love"), St. Patrick's Day ("stpaddy"), Summer ("summer"), Independence Day ("freedom") and Halloween ("spooky"). When making your own, use the included themes as reference. Your files must match the dimensions of the included themes and be .png (with transparency). Then in Visualizer you or anyone you share the files with clicks on the lock and enters the name of your theme, and voila. If you named your files "valentines_overlay.png" and "valentines_button.png", the password would be "valentines" in Visualizer. C3 Authors must make sure to get admin approval if they're planning to use any custom designs.

PRO UPGRADE BUNDLER
- Fixed bug that had broken ability to use pro upgrade con

WII CONVERTER
- Added option to replace non-working .milo_wii files with a working basic one from an official song. It is not a perfect solution but it gives you some sort of camera cuts and lighting effects, rather than a static camera. This option is only available when doing Smart Folder Merge. 

PHASE SHIFT CONVERTER
- Added option to replace the genre with the song's subgenre. Note that Phase Shift does NOT support subgenres, so this replaces the genre with subgenre in the song.ini file, not add both.

----------

v2.3.5
VISUALIZER
- Added ability to use TIFF (*.tif), GIF (*.gif) and DDS (*.dds) images for the album art

GENERAL
- No longer using Tao.DevIL.dll or ILUT.dll (you can safely remove them if you still have them, no longer included with the program files)
- Greatly improved image handling to avoid crashes and more efficient processing
- Testing different way to enlarge/shrink images, let me hear your opinion! Better? Worse? The same? (= better because cleaner code).

----------

v2.3.3
VISUALIZER
- Added ability to display song rating (FF = Family Friendly, SR = Supervision Recommended, M = Mature, NR = Not Rated)

- Changed behavior to account for long album names to shorten and add ellipsis (...) rather than have the text go off-screen 
- Changed behavior to replace "feat." and "featuring" with the much shorter "ft." to save space and generate text at an easier to read size
- Greatly improved the SPLIT behavior for better splitting and text resizing after splitting
- Fixed bug that would allow Genre/Sub-Genre to be moved up even when there was existing Album Name text
- Fixed bug that would show both Rhythm on Keys / Rhythm on Bass icons when importing a song that was compiled with the Rhythm on Bass marker in Magma.
- Other minor improvements

- Other minor fixes

----------

v2.3.1
VISUALIZER
- Added ability to estimate whether a song is Expert-Only based on the contents of the MIDI charts. This should be "pretty good" at determining whether there are "some" reductions, not whether the reductions are done to any standard. Still, tests show a 90%+ accuracy. If you want more details as to what is and isn't in the MIDIs, you might want to use the MIDI Tester feature that will be available in Magma: C3 Roks Edition v2 soon.

CON EXPLORER
- Fixed bug that would cause a crash when extracting a file via right-click menu. TIP: You can extract files by drag/dropping them to your desktop/folder!

PHASE SHIFT CONVERTER (NEW!)
- Quickly and accurately converts CON/LIVE files to Phase Shift format - all the features that Phase Shift supports that are present in the CON are preserved!
- Only step you have to do manually is separate the mogg into individual ogg files - program can automatically send the mogg to Audacity for you
- Program can automatically RAR each converted song if you want to share them - will automatically append _phaseshift to each RAR archive
- By default, C3's banner (banner.png in the program directory) is included with Phase Shift songs, change that with another image if you'd like your own banner
- By default, the loading phrase is set to "www.customscreators.com" - to change it create a text file, name it loading_phrase.txt and place it in the program directory, enter anything you want to show up as your loading phrase in there

PACK CREATOR
- Added Thumbnail Viewer feature - will display the Package Image thumbnails for all the files loaded prior to building the pack - up to the first 100 files loaded. Just drag the thumbnail you want to either the Package Image or Content Image boxes

- Improved the restore form feature - if you hide or minimize a form, click on any empty space on the main form to restore it
- Hopefully fixed all instances of the code where user could not delete a folder/file until closing the program down
- Added ability to open Wii Converter directly in the desired folder by passing the argument as -wii -folderpath - future update to Magma will use this

----------

v2.2.2
WII CONVERTER
- Added option to clear contents of folder before starting to avoid duplicates/file conflicts
- Fixed bug where preview start time would only show 1:0 instead of 1:00

----------

v2.0.0 RC1
BATCH RENAMER (NEW!)
- Allows you to rename and/or sort your files in a batch!
- Enable 'Rename files' if you want your files to be renamed (enabled by default) - can choose from four formatting options: "The Artist - Song", "Artist, The - Song", "Song - The Artist" or "Song - Artist, The" - renaming works by grabbing the artist and song from the songs.dta file for single songs (99%+ accurate?) - for pro upgrades and packs, it uses a bit of logic based on naming conventions and patterns (~90% accurate)
- If you want to replace blank spaces in your file name with underscores, select that option before clicking Begin ('Rename files' must be selected)
- Whether you're renaming or not, enable 'Try to sort files' to do basic top level sorting = sorting of the files based on established naming conventions - will sort to "pro_upgrades", "hmx_dlc", "c3_dlc", "rbn", "ghtorb3", "beatles" and "pony_rock"
- Enable "Try detailed sub-sorting" if you want to have sub-sorting into "rb1" and "rb2" subfolders (rb3 content stays in main sorted folder), and then finally "packs" or "albums"
- Will also find duplicates! - default behavior is to append (2)(3), etc - select 'Delete older copies' to delete files with older "last modified on" dates with the same internal file name (i.e. v3 of a song for which you have v4), select "Delete exact copies ONLY" to delete files with same name, file size and "last modified on" date (i.e. exact duplicates of a file) - duplicates are sent to your Recycle Bin rather than deleted from your hard drive, so you can restore your files if something went wrong

DTA EXTRACTOR (NEW!)
- Allows you to batch extract the songs.dta files from CON/LIVE files very quickly
- Provides several naming options so the files aren't all named "songs.dta" - 5 different naming options available
- Can remove spaces in file names or replace with underscores for post-processing with software that doesn't like spaces

ALBUM ART EXTRACTOR (NEW!)
- Allows you to batch extract the album art files (png_xbox) from CON/LIVE files
- Will extract from single songs as well as from packs!
- Provides several naming options so the files aren't all named the same - 5 different naming options available
- Can remove spaces in file names or replace with underscores for post-processing with software that doesn't like spaces
- After extracting, allows you to go straight into Album Art Converter to convert your files

VISUALIZER
- Added ability to mark a song as having 2x Bass Pedal icon (click on the drum icon to toggle)
- Added 'RB3 version' and 'Expert Only' icons to the Icon Panel
- Removed second 'Convert' icon and re-designed the Icons Panel
- Greatly improved how icons are enabled/disabled: double-click on any icon in the Icons Panel to send it down, or drag and drop it. In the template box, you can also drag and drop the icons from slot 1 to slot 2, and vice versa
- Added ability to read subgenre from song. Can only display genre OR subgenre, click on the the one you want to show
- Added ability to overwrite font size...will always auto-size first, then you can enlarge or shrink the Song Title, Artist Name and/or Song Duration
- Added ability to split Song Title or Artist Name into two lines - just type the whole thing, then click on "Split": Visualizer will try to split as close to the middle of the phrase as possible without splitting a word. Click on "Join" to go back from two lines to one line
- Added ability to move the Song Title and the Artist Name - just click on the arrows and move the mouse around. This works with both one-line and two-line names
- Added ability to change font color individually for each component of the image! Just click on the color bar next to the name of the field (i.e. next to Song Title)
- Added ability to lower/raise the Year - it will be aligned to the Album Name or the Genre (this is useful for longer album names that typically overlap the Year)
- Changed previous restriction so Song Duration can now show up to 7 characters (i.e. 1:23:45) since the new Magma allows us to go beyond an hour
- Changed and improved code that reads song duration from songs.dta to take into account 60 minute+ songs
- Changed and improved drag-and-drop code - can now drop an image anywhere on the form and it will be assigned to the album art, and can drag and drop a song (CON or LIVE) anywhere on the form, including on the previously-restricted album art box and it will be loaded and processed
- Greatly improved uploading code: if fails will ask if want to retry, and can handle user input
- Changed default uploading / saving behavior: default is now to just upload to Imgur without making a local copy, you can check off "Local" to also save to your hard drive, uncheck "Imgur" if you ONLY want to save a local copy and not upload it to Imgur automatically
- Changed uploading behavior: link is copied to clipboard automatically but browser won't open unless you click on the link
- Changed the tiering behavior to show pro guitar/bass/keys difficulties when present rather than their 5-lane counterparts
- Added ability to read new metadata saved by Magma: C3 Roks Edition (whether song is karaoke, multitrack, expert-only, etc)
- Added field to show you who the author of the song is (if they're using Magma: C3 Roks Edition)
- Visualizer will try to make an educated guess as to whether the song is official DLC from HMX, from RBN or one of the GHtoRB3 tracks
- Added ability to interpret the contents of the Song Title: if the Song Title contains (RB3 version) (Rhythm Version) or (2x Bass Pedal), it will automatically select the appropriate icon(s) and remove it from the Song Title for you for a cleaner image
- Added ability to save / load 'Visualizer Profile' = saves the colors and font sizes for each component, so you can set your color scheme, save it, and load it at any time. Once you load a profile, that will become the "default" values until you close Visualizer (hint: you can distribute a custom Visualizer Profile with your custom skins)
- Reworked the font loading process: if "font.otf" or "font.ttf" are found in the 'res' folder, it will default to that (hint: this can be used to distribute a custom font with your custom skins), if not, it will default to the included c3.otf font. If the chosen font is not already installed, Visualizer will open it for you and prompt you to install the font. The program will close, run it again after installing the font and you will be good to go...PLEASE NOTE that not all fonts will work well with Visualizer's auto-size feature and GDI+ graphics drawing method. If your font doesn't play nice, you can still use it but you must set the size manually
- Improved code that verifies the song is not a pack - Visualizer no longer needs to extract the pack to determine it has more than once song inside
- Added small graphic to let you know Visualizer is loading when drag-n-dropping a large CON file (takes a few seconds)
- Changed the look to match the new "look"

PACK CREATOR
- Changed encoding for the songs.dta files - they now are encoded using UTF8 encoding and the line "encoding 'latin1'" is replaced with "encoding 'utf8'" - this should resolve most of the non-standard character issues caused by previous Packager
- Improved the option to use an existing folder structure (i.e. previously extracted and prepared pack) - Click on 'Advaced' -> 'Use existing folder structure' - YOU MUST SELECT THE SONGS FOLDER (i.e. "songs\yoursong\" - select the songs folder)
- If you load the Packager, and there were previously extracted files, and you accidentally click "No" (so it deletes and starts from scratch), your folder is moved to the Recycle Bin rather than deleted from your hard drive, so you can restore it
- Enabled changing the Content Image (previously locked) and switched order of images to make more sense
- Can now drag and drop images to both image fields
- When changing either the Content Image or the Package Image, defaults to included folder of images provided by C16 (THANKS!)

ALBUM ART CONVERTER
- Several code improvements and general cleanup
- Changed the look to match the new "look"

- Added ability to add new files to existing package either by drag and dropping the files into the bottom panel, or right click and choose 'Add file(s)'
- Added ability to replace file by drag and dropping over the existing file in the bottom panel (can only replace file with same filetype - i.e., .mid with .mid, etc)
- Removed "option" to add new folder since it was never coded to work
- File sizes now display in KB or MB, so it makes more sense than looking at size in bytes
- Added option to change game ID from and to RB1, RB2 and RB3 - ONLY USE THIS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!
- Changing game ID will automatically change Content Image to match
- Enabled changing the Content Image (previously locked) and switched order of images to make more sense
- Can now drag and drop images to both image fields
- When changing either the Content Image or the Package Image, defaults to included folder of images provided by C16 (THANKS!)

- Considerable code improvements
- Re-created the form from scratch to break away from the constraints of the old Le Fluffie DevNet controls and changed the "look"

CON CREATOR
- Added ability to drag and drop entire folders [on the left panel] ... files inside the folder are automatically added as well. If it's a song folder structure, the "gen" subfolder and those files will also be added...if "songs.dta" is present, it will also be added
- Added ability to drag and drop files [on the right panel]
- Added option to change Game ID to Rock Band, Rock Band 2, and Rock Band 3 (default) - when changing ID the Content Image will automatically change for you to match

- Fixed deleting of multiple files: select the ones you want to delete, right click on any of them, delete. Bam, works as intended.
- Removed option to rename files/folders. It was messy and didn't always work well. Just make sure files/folders are named correctly before you add them.
- Major code improvements and clean-up
- Re-designed most of the form to break away form the old Le Fluffie "look" and only give you what you need for Rock Band purposes

GENERAL
- now accepts arguments! This means you can create shortcuts with one of the following arguments and it will bypass the main screen and go straight to that form, which saves you time if you only ever use the Visualizer, for example. Valid arguments are "-visualizer" "-artconverter" "-packcreator" "-renamer" "-artextractor" "-dtaextractor" and "-songpackager". Only one argument per shortcut. Add it to your shortcut after the .exe: ...C3CONTools.exe" -visualizer
- program can now be opened via command line with the file path to a CON/LIVE file as the argument - will open in Song Explorer (now used by Magma: C3 Roks Edition!)
- Re-envisioned the "look" of the program - new modular look that will allow for further expansion rather than the already crowded drop-down menu system
- Miscellanous code improvements

X360 LIBRARY
- No longer using x360.dll, but instead imported only the relevant parts of the source code, cleaned it up, and fixed some parts that had problems...this may mean further improvements down the line as I fix up the library.

v1.0.0
- Initial release, based on code from Le Fluffie:

GENERAL
- reskinned (sorry furries)
- streamlined to remove non-RB3 forms and code (chat, updater, plus a host of others)
- easily access two rb3 functions (open package, create package) + added functions from menu bar

CON EXPLORER
- can change format (CON/LIVE), sign and unlock from this form by selecting a format -> rebuild (saves all other changes made to the package as well)
- can change the package and content images by clicking on the existing ones -> rebuild (saves all other changes made to the package as well)
- removed non-RB3 windows
- clicking on nodes expands them (i.e. no more clicking on the + sign)
- replace file only allows same extension as file being replaced 
- extract file only allows same extension as file being extracted
- removed extra context menus

CON CREATOR
- all defaults set to RB3 and locked (internal name, publisher, game id, content image)
- package image default to RB3 icon, can be changed by clicking on the image (no more default furry cat!)
- Title Display/Description now save automatically as text is typed in, and save to correct place in Header (was inverted before).
- rename folder function fixed so it works correctly, before would rename first node ("Root")
- when adding new nodes (i.e. "songs" or "gen" folders), they auto-expand for you.
- all other windows hidden with defaults set for RB3
- fixed bug where if added a folder, deleted or renamed it, and tried to add a folder with the same name, it wouldn't work
- Create package button moved to initial screen for faster access
- added buttons to select type live/con to initial screen = do entire process from the same screen
-----selecting LIVE/CON will change the package type automatically from MARKETPLACE TO SAVED GAME
- packages will be created either as LIVE/CON but always unlocked
- when creating a package, file name pre-populated for you based on first entry under "songs" (allows you to change it)

ALBUM ART CONVERTER (NEW!)
- converts from png_xbox -> bmp and bmp -> png_xbox
----one or multiple files at a time
----option to delete original files
