## ⚠️ Important

This repository contains **source code only**.

Required runtime binaries are distributed under **Releases**.

See **BUILDING.md** for compile instructions.

## About

**Nautilus** is a multi-tool suite originally created to **create, edit, and work with Rock Band files**. Over time, it has grown to support files from **other rhythm games** as well.

Development began in **2013** and continues to the present  
(as of this edit, **December 13, 2025**).

Nautilus has accumulated a large number of tools over the years — explore the interface and see if it does what you need. Most features include Help documentation; however, not all of it has been kept fully up to date. Contributions to documentation are always welcome.

## Building Nautilus

If you plan to compile Nautilus **without modifying the source code**, you **must** follow the instructions in **BUILDING.md**.

Nautilus depends on:
- External libraries
- Third-party tools
- Runtime assets

All of these are required for correct operation.

### Development Environment

- **Language:** C#  
- **Framework:** .NET Framework **4.8.0**  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio **2022 Community Edition**

For best results, use the same environment.

## Community & Support

If you have technical questions or want to discuss Nautilus:

- You can find me in most **Rock Band–related Discord servers** under the same username
- I also run a dedicated Discord server:

**“Nemo’s Nautilus”**

Send me a message and let’s talk.
