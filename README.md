# Nautilus

⚠️ Important:
This repository contains source code only.
Required runtime binaries are available under Releases.
See BUILDING.md for compile instructions.

Developed by Nemo between 2013 and present time (as of this edit, December 13, 2025).

Initially a tool suite to create, edit and work with Rock Band files, now it works with some files from other rhythm games as well.
Check out the many buttons and see if it'll do what you need. Most features have a Help document but unfortunately I haven't kept up with updating them. Hopefully whoever starts working on this updates the Help documents.

If you're going to just download and compile without much or any editing to the source code, please make sure to follow the instructions on BUILDING.md. There are dependencies, third-party tools and assets Nautilus expects to have access to to function correctly.

Nautilus is written in C# using .NET Framework 4.8.0 and using Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition. For best results make sure you use the same.

If you have technical questions or want to discuss Nautilus with me, I can be found in most Rock Band related Discord servers under the same username. **I also have my own Discord server called "Nemo's Nautilus"** - send me a message and let's talk.

Nautilus wouldn't be possible without the groundwork and assistance of others, so let's get into it.
